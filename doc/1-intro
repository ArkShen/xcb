Thank you for using XCUBE!  XCUBE is a real-time computing framework for
derivatives.  Basically, it has three major components: dispatcher(xcb-dp2),
worker(xcb-wk2) and publisher(xcb-pb2).  Dispatchers receive quotes from
different sources, and reliably multicast them down to workers; Workers are the
workhorses of the whole system: they compute various useful results based on the
quotes they got, and multicast again down to publishers; Publishers maintain a
very simple API for clients' use, and they deliver the computing results
according to clients' requirements.

It is clear to see that reliable multicasting is a connecting tie between the
three parts above.  But it is also a cause of time delay in the system.  So
there exists a compactor(xcb-compact) which completely eliminates the reliable
multicasting, thus combines three parts into one.  In other words, if you have
a few number of machines, use the dispatcher-worker-publisher pattern; if you
got just one machine, use the compactor only.
